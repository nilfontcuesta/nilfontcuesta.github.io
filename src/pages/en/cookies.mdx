## 1. What are cookies?
A cookie is a small text file that is stored in your browser when you visit almost any website. Its purpose is to allow the website to remember your visit when you return to browse that page.

On this website, we prioritize privacy and technical simplicity; therefore, **we do not use third-party cookies** (such as Google Analytics or social media plugins) or any user tracking systems.

## 2. Use of Local Storage (LocalStorage)
Instead of traditional cookies, this website uses your browser's **Local Storage** technology for purely technical and functional purposes. This technology allows us to save preferences that are not sent to our server and remain on your device.

Specifically, the following data is stored:

- **Language (`language`):** Used to remember if you have selected Catalan, Spanish, or English, preventing you from having to choose the language every time you access the site.
- **Visual Theme (`theme`):** Used to remember your interface preference (Light Mode or Dark Mode).

## 3. Third-party cookies
This website **does not use third-party cookies** for analytical, advertising, or tracking purposes.

However, since the page is hosted on **GitHub Pages**, the service provider (GitHub, Inc.) may use its own cookies or similar technologies for security purposes and to ensure the delivery of content. You can consult GitHub's privacy policy for further details.

## 4. Management and Deletion
Since these preferences are stored directly in your browser, you can delete them at any time by clearing your browsing data or your browser's cache.

Likewise, you can configure your browser to block the use of cookies and local storage, although in that case, you will need to re-select your language and visual theme each time you visit us.

## 5. Consent
By browsing this website, the user accepts the use of these necessary technical technologies for the correct and personalized functioning of the interface as established in this policy.
